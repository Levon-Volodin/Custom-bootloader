# Custom-bootloader
custom master boot record written in x86 assembly for the intel instruction sets
* WILL NOT WORK ON AMD64

this is a really old project and my other (working) master boot record was lost to time (just like a lot of other good programs source code but oh well) and since I havent been able to find it I just wrote a new one (not sure if it still works but eh)

- created just for fun
